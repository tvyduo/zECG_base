# Custom Zebrafish ECG Analysis Software
We created a MATLAB-based GUI specifically to analyze zebrafish ECG traces called zERG. zERG can be found at: https://github.com/tvyduo/zERG. Labchart users can convert the .txt files into .mat files using a paid version of Labchart (following the export instructions above). To read the .txt files directly into zERG, remove the header(s) and ensure that only two columns are present: the times of the voltages (first column) and the voltages themeselves. zERG currently only supports display of one channel of the trace (i.e. the raw data from channel 1 and the processed data from channel 4 cannot be analyzed using zERG at the same time).
